        <h1>Natural environment</h1>
        <p>
           The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is 
           most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources 
           that affect human survival and economic activity.[1] The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components:

           Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks,
           atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.
           Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge,
           and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.

        <h1>Universe</h1>
        <p>
            The universe is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. 
            The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged 
            together 13.799Â±0.021 billion years ago,[2] and the universe has been expanding ever since. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] the 
            cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter of 23 trillion light years,[11] and it is possible to measure the size of the observable 
            universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.

            The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. Over 
            the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. 
            In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations 
            by Tycho Brahe.

        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <p>
            People from all walks of life, both young and old, enjoy traveling. When traveling, the traveler has many exceptional opportunities presented to them. The 
            traveler gets the chance to experience new things, make choices, reward themselves, and to gain knowledge of the world outside their own.
            First, the most exciting opportunity for a traveler is to experience new things. They may get to experience a different religion, perhaps. Doing so may attract 
            them towards an area of study to possibly pursue in the future. Also, when in a different part of the world, many geographical areas have their own unique food 
            choices. This will give the voyager a chance to try some new cooking. In addition to these opportunities, each society has their own exclusive celebrations and 
            festivities. When traveling, the tourist gets a chance to take part in celebrations and festivities which enhances their experience in their current destination.
            Secondly, there is educational side to traveling. Travelers gain and expand their knowledge of the outside world when visiting new locations. It widens their 
            perspective of the world so they do not think all corners of the land are the same. The adventurers will discover similarities and differences between cultures. 
            They will learn the history and background of cultures and geographical areas. And furthermore, the new experiences help to expand ones resourcefulness and 
            provides marvellous insights.
